      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Government and cultural organizations need to launch projects quickly, but their discovery process is slow, fragmented, and difficult to align across teams. Important details get lost in meetings, documents, and email threads, making it hard to form a clear brief. This leads to delays, miscommunication, and extra effort for both clients and agencies like Innovate By Day.
      </p>

      <h2>Our Solution</h2>
      <p>
        Our AI Discovery Assistant brings all project information together and turns it into a clear, structured draft brief within minutes. It analyzes meeting notes, client documents, and intake answers, identifies missing details, and creates a visual summary plus a Scope of Work. This gives government and cultural organizations a faster, more organized project kickoff—while IBD keeps full creative control and adds the final human touch.

# Development-Tools-Final-Assignment Reflection 
My Storyworks idea focuses on an AI-powered briefing assistant designed to help organizations, especially government and cultural institutions, start projects more efficiently by turning intake responses, meeting notes, and client documents into clear draft briefs. My website promotes this idea by presenting it like a real digital product: it explains the problem, showcases benefits, highlights features, and ends with a call-to-action section that invites users to explore more or get in touch. I used a clean, modern layout, consistent visual styling, and strong messaging to communicate the value of the tool.
During the process, one of the key challenges I faced was translating a complex, abstract concept (an AI workflow system) into a simple, visual, and user-friendly website. It was easy for the content to become too long or too technical. To overcome this, I broke the information into clear sections, used concise wording, and added visual hierarchy through cards, grids, and headings. Another challenge was making the site fully responsive, especially because my layout included multiple grids, and a flexible hero section. I solved this by adding media queries, testing on several screen sizes, and adjusting spacing and grid columns for tablets and mobile devices.
Beyond form validation, I implemented additional JavaScript interactivity to make the website feel more dynamic. I added a Read More / Read Less toggle that expands or collapses additional text based on user interaction. This improves usability and keeps long sections of content manageable on smaller screens. I also used class toggling to smoothly update button labels so users immediately understand what action they’re taking.
For deployment, I used GitHub Pages because it is simple, fast, free, and fully integrated with version control. It allowed me to push changes directly from my repository and immediately see updates live.
